== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The `[random_post_on_refresh]` shortcode supports a few attributes to give you more control over the results:

* **author** - Provide an author ID or a comma-separated list of author IDs if you want to limit the random post to one of those authors. Example: `[random_post_on_refresh author="1, 11, 14"]`

* **ids** - Provide a comma-separated list of post IDs to pull random posts from.  Example: `[random_post_on_refresh ids="19, 87, 113, 997"]`

* **image_required** - Only applies when the `show` attribute contains `image`. This attribute defaults to `true` and will cause WordPress to filter out any posts without images. If set to `false`, then posts with or without images will be shown.  Example: `[random_post_on_refresh show="title, image" image_required="false"]`

* **not** - Provide a comma-separated list of post IDs to exclude. Example: `[random_post_on_refresh not="3, 456, 876"]`

* **post_type** - Provide a post type or a comma-separated list of post types to pull from. You must use the internal post type name. Default is `post`. Example: `[random_post_on_refresh post_type="page"]`

* **search** - Provide a custom search term to limit the random posts returned.  Example: `[random_post_on_refresh search="relativity"]`

* **taxonomy** - Provide a custom taxonomy to pull from. Requires the `terms` attribute to be set as well. Example: `[random_post_on_refresh taxonomy="post_tag" terms="2,4"]`

* **terms** - Provide a term ID or comma-separated list of term IDs to limit the random posts returned. Requires the `taxonomy` attribute to be set as well. Example: `[random_post_on_refresh taxonomy="post_tag" terms="2,4"]`

* **class** - Provide a custom class name for the wrapping HTML div. Example: `[random_post_on_refresh class="my-custom-class"]`

* **size** - Provide a registered image size to use for image display (optional, only takes effect if images are being shown). Example: `[random_post_on_refresh size="thumbnail"]`

* **show** - Provide a comma-separated list of post elements to display. You can also use a vertical pipe `|` character instead of a comma to separate items into columns. Options are: title, image, excerpt, content. Defaults to `title, image, excerpt`. Items will show in the order you provide. Note: If images are shown, only posts with featured images will be returned. Example: `[random_post_on_refresh show="title, image"]`

Keep in mind that any of these attributes can be combined as needed.  Example: `[random_post_on_refresh author="19" size="full" not="2310"]`.  Also, keep in mind that the shortcode can be used in text widgets.
